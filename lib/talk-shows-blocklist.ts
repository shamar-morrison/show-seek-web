/**
 * Curated data for the `hideTalkShowsAndAwards` preference.
 *
 * TMDB has no single genre that covers talk shows, late-night, daytime talk,
 * news talk and award ceremonies, so filtering combines three narrow layers
 * (see `lib/non-scripted-filter.ts`):
 *
 * 1. Genre IDs — only Talk (10767) and News (10763). Reality (10764) and
 *    War & Politics (10768) are deliberately NOT blanket-banned so scripted
 *    shows like Survivor, The West Wing or House of Cards keep showing.
 * 2. TMDB TV ID blocklist — numeric IDs below are restricted to entries
 *    already referenced elsewhere (1408 = SNL, 2224 = The Daily Show).
 *    Everything else is covered by the title list and name patterns instead
 *    of guessed numeric IDs: a wrong numeric ID could collide with a
 *    scripted show and hide it for everyone, while an exact-title match can
 *    never collide with a differently-titled scripted show. Extend the ID
 *    set only with verified TMDB IDs.
 * 3. Exact-title list + award-ceremony name patterns — covers the popular and
 *    niche long tail (late-night, daytime, UK chat, morning shows, aftershows,
 *    ceremonies) including entries that TMDB genres as Comedy/Reality.
 *
 * Performance: all structures are built once at module load (`Set` for O(1)
 * lookups, pre-compiled `RegExp`s). The filter itself is a synchronous,
 * allocation-free predicate that runs inside the existing `useContentFilter`
 * memo — no network, no storage, no extra renders.
 *
 * Ported verbatim from the mobile app
 * (`src/constants/talkShowsBlocklist.ts`) — keep the two in sync.
