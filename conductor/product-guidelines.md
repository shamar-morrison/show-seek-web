# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity
- **Theme:** Modern & Dark-Mode First. The interface prioritizes a cinematic, high-contrast dark theme (e.g., deep grays/blacks) to make movie posters and media assets pop.
- **Imagery:** High-quality, immersive media assets (posters, backdrops) are the focal point of the design.
- **Accent Colors:** Vibrant accent colors are used sparingly for calls-to-action (e.g., "Add to Watchlist," "Play Trailer") to guide user attention without overwhelming the content.
- **Typography:** Clean, sans-serif typography ensures readability across all devices, with clear hierarchy between headings (movie titles) and body text (synopses, reviews).

## User Experience (UX) Principles
- **Cinematic Immersion:** The design should feel like an extension of the viewing experience. Smooth transitions, subtle animations, and large visual elements create an engaging atmosphere.
- **Effortless Discovery:** Navigation should be intuitive, allowing users to browse categories, search, and filter with minimal clicks.
- **Seamless Tracking:** Actions like "Mark as Watched" or "Rate" should be frictionless and accessible directly from media cards or detail pages.
- **Mobile-First Responsiveness:** The experience must be consistent and fully functional on mobile devices, where many users will likely log their activity.
- **Performance:** Fast load times and smooth scrolling are critical, especially when rendering large lists of media items.

## Voice and Tone
- **Enthusiastic & Knowledgeable:** The platform communicates with the passion of a movie buff—inviting, informed, and appreciative of the content.
- **Clear & Concise:** Interface text and messages are direct and helpful, avoiding jargon.
- **Community-Focused:** Encourages interaction and sharing, fostering a sense of belonging among users.

## Accessibility
- **Contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and backgrounds, especially in the dark theme.
- **Navigation:** Support full keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
- **Touch Targets:** Maintain adequate touch target sizes for mobile users.
